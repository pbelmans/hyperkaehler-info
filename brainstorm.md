Thorsten's suggestions
----------------------

[ ] Riemann--Roch polynomial

[x] Hodge numbers

[ ] highest order of (anti-)symplectic automorphism (which is of finite order)

[ ] which polarization type their Lagrangian fibrations have

[ ] isometry type of the Beauville--Bogomolov--Fujiki form

[ ] integral of square root of Todd class

[ ] monodromy group

[ ] derived monodromy group

[ ] Larsen--Lunts--Verbitsky decomposition of cohomology

[ ] whether certain conjectures are known:
  [ ] SYZ
  [ ] BV
  [ ] base of Lagrangian fibrations base is P^n
  [ ] integral Hodge conjecture

[ ] largest-dimensional known families (e.g. whether we know locally complete algebraic families in this deformation type or not)

My suggestions
--------------

[x] Chern numbers

[x] Fujiki constant

[ ]Â stable Betti numbers? some Heisenberg stuff?


To be done
----------

[ ] references for all the things Thorsten suggested

[ ] ask Georg about modular forms

[ ] ask Daniel about other suggestions
