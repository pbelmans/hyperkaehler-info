Thorsten's suggestions
----------------------

[ ] Riemann--Roch polynomial
  (look at Ortiz preprint)

[x] Hodge numbers

[ ] highest order of (anti-)symplectic automorphism (which is of finite order)
  anti-symplectic: upper bound on the order is b_2, ...?
  symplectic: ?, for K3 surfaces the upper bound is 8

[x] which polarization type their Lagrangian fibrations have
  K3^[n]: they are always PPAV
  in general: a bunch of integers dividing each other
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09010.pdf: Kum^n type
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07173.pdf: OG6 has (1,2,2)
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12511.pdf: OG10 has (1,1,1,1,1) (Theorem 2.2)
  (OG6 and OG10 have biggest possible monodromy group, that's why they only have 1 example, unlike Kum^n, which has a multitude of possibilities)

[x] isometry type of the Beauville--Bogomolov--Fujiki form

  [x] include signature
  [x] discriminant group
  [?] qbar

[x] integral of square root of Todd class

[?] monodromy group
  large subgroup of O(H^2(X,Z)): always at least index 2
  if index is precisely 2 then birational Torelli holds
  K3: index 2
  K3^[n]: 2^{\rho(n)-1}
  appendix B of https://73df973a-474a-47c7-8990-13cfbbbe9b88.filesusr.com/ugd/ad33a9_bc50fb1efa284ea4a42b1a39d51380e1.pdf

[x] discriminant
  appendix B of https://73df973a-474a-47c7-8990-13cfbbbe9b88.filesusr.com/ugd/ad33a9_bc50fb1efa284ea4a42b1a39d51380e1.pdf
  for even lattice we have discriminant group, and get a Q/2Z-valued form, this is q in Debarre's appendix

[ ] derived monodromy group
  Theorem 8.1 of http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/beckmann/Files/DerHK.pdf
  (maybe too premature right now)

[ ] LLV algebra

[ ] Larsen--Lunts--Verbitsky decomposition of cohomology
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03432
  Corollary 3.2 and 3.6
  Verbitsky component is V{n}, and has a Hodge decomposition

[ ] whether certain conjectures are known:
  [ ] SYZ: square-zero (as in using BBF, what nonsense is this) divisor and nef induces a Lagrangian fibration
    K3: yes, = giving elliptic fibrations
    K3^[n] and Kum^n: Corollary 1.1 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.0896.pdf
    OG6: Corollary 1.3 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07173.pdf
    OG10: Theorem 2.2 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12511.pdf

  [ ] BV (Beauville-Voisin)
    subalgebra of Chow group generated by divisors and Chern classes of the tangent bundle injects into cohomology
    = all relations are only cohomological
    K3: Beauville--Voisin
    K3^[n]: not for the full deformation type, but known for K3^[n] or Fano varieties of lines on a cubic fourfold
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05262)
    Kum^n: https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4977
    (not a deformation-invariant property, so maybe not include it?)

  [ ] base of Lagrangian fibrations base is P^n
    this is not the SYZ conjecture: need to control the number of sections of the square-zero line bundle
    if it has more sections, the image becomes a subvariety of a bigger projective space
    there is a conjecture that h^0 is always n+1

  [ ] integral Hodge conjecture
    K3: known
    only for families in higher dimensions
    (leave this out)

[ ] signature
  it's already there in fact, but because I couldn't find any reference that really uses it I left it out for now
  is there a nice generating series maybe?
  I guess one criterion for inclusion could be: are the sequences in the OEIS (right now they are not)

[ ] largest-dimensional known families (e.g. whether we know locally complete algebraic families in this deformation type or not)
  according to Thorsten this is listable:
  - moduli of objects in K3 categories (inside cubic fourfolds and Gushel--Mukai, in the 6-author paper and Perry-Pertusi-Zhao)
  - and then at most 10 other known families
    - Fano variety of lines on a cubic fourfold
    - Debarre--Voisin varieties
    - Lehn--Lehn--Sorger--van Straten
    - double EPW sextic
    - varieties of power sums: Iliev--Ranestadt

    these have a dimension
    and a given polarization, so there's a square of the polarization
    Mongardi--Rapagnetta

[ ] Sawon's degree of the discriminant of a Lagrangian fibration

My suggestions
--------------

[x] Chern numbers

[x] Fujiki constant

  [ ] check how the invariants in 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02087.pdf compare to what is currently written on the website

[ ] stable Betti numbers? some Heisenberg stuff?
  section 5 and appendix of https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0009109.pdf
  b_2k stabilises for S^[k]?

[x] top Chern number: link to https://oeis.org/A006922 and https://oeis.org/A282211


To be done
----------

[x] references for all the things Thorsten suggested

[ ] ask Georg about modular forms

[x] ask Daniel about other suggestions
